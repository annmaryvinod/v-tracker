## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**  
- [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for dependency management  
- **MongoDB Atlas** (or a local MongoDB instance)  
- **Uvicorn** for running the FastAPI server  
- **Redis** (optional, for background task processing & notifications)  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (optional, for containerized deployment)  

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:annmaryvinod/v-tracker.git
cd v-tracker
```

### Install Dependencies

We use Poetry for dependency management. If you don't have Poetry installed, install it first:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

After installing the dependencies, activate the virtual environment by entering the Poetry shell:

```bash
poetry shell
```

This will spawn a new shell within the virtual environment, where you can run the application and manage dependencies.

## Running the Application

### Configure Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `configs/` directory or use the provided example:

```bash
cp configs/.env.example configs/.env.local
```

Edit the `configs/.env.local` file and provide the necessary configuration, including your database URL and Hugging Face API token.

### Initialize the Database

Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running. To set up the database schema, apply migrations by running:

```bash
make migrate-up
```

To rollback migrations, use:

```bash
make migrate-down
```

### Development Server

To run the development server with auto-reload and centralized `__pycache__`, use the `dev` command in the `Makefile`:

```bash
make dev
```

This will start the FastAPI application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Alternatively, if you haven't activated the Poetry shell, you can run the development server directly using:

```bash
poetry run dev
```

### Testing the API

You can test the API by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your web browser. This will bring up the interactive Swagger UI documentation where you can interact with the API endpoints.

### Production Server

For production deployment, you might want to use a production-grade server like `gunicorn` along with `uvicorn` workers.

Example command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Directory Breakdown

### ðŸ“‚ Directory Breakdown

- **`app/`**: Main application directory containing the core of the FastAPI backend.
  - **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for database seeding, migrations, or cron jobs.
  - **`config/`**: Configuration files for application settings and environment variables.
  - **`main.py`**: The entry point of the FastAPI application, initializing the API, middleware, and routes.
  - **`routers/`**: Defines API routes using FastAPI's `APIRouter`, including user authentication, child records, and vaccination tracking.
  - **`utils/`**: Helper functions for tasks like email reminders, token generation, and logging.
  - **`models/`**: MongoDB models representing collections such as users, children, and vaccination records.
  - **`services/`**: Business logic layer handling user authentication, vaccine schedule calculations, and reminders.
  - **`store/`**: Database connection and repository layer for MongoDB Atlas.
  - **`schemas/`**: Pydantic models for request validation and response serialization.
- **`configs/`**: Contains configuration files such as `.env` for managing environment variables.
- **`tests/`**: Unit and integration tests for API endpoints and business logic.
- **`Makefile`**: Automation scripts for running common development tasks (e.g., starting the server, linting).
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Poetry configuration file defining project dependencies and settings.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for setting up and running the project.
- **`LICENSE`**: License file specifying the projectâ€™s usage terms.
 

### Where to Keep What

- **`configs/`**: Store all configuration-related files, such as environment variables (`.env`).  
- **`app/routers/`**: Define API endpoints here. Each module should have its own file (e.g., `users.py` for user-related routes).  
- **`app/models/`**: Store MongoDB schema models (e.g., `user.py`, `vaccine.py`).  
- **`app/schemas/`**: Keep Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.  
- **`app/services/`**: Place business logic and model interactions here. This ensures a clear separation of concerns.  
- **`app/utils/`**: Utility functions such as JWT token generation, email notifications, and logging should be stored here.  
- **`app/store/`**: Manage database connections and repository functions in this directory.  
- **`app/scripts/`**: Any standalone scripts, such as database migrations or data seeding scripts, go here.  
- **`tests/`**: Keep all test cases here, following the structure of the `app/` directory for easy mapping.  

## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These can be set in `.env` files located in the `configs/` directory.

Example `configs/.env.local`:

```ini
# configs/.env.local
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8000
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=
```

Make sure to create or update the `.env` files according to your environment (development, production, etc.).

## Linting and Code Style

We use `black` for code formatting, `isort` for import sorting, and `flake8` for linting.

### Running Linters

To format and lint the code, use the provided `Makefile` commands:

```bash
make format  # Formats the code using black and isort
make lint    # Lints the code using flake8
```

Alternatively, you can run them via Poetry:

```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .
poetry run flake8 .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use `pre-commit` to enforce code style before commits. Pre-commit hooks can be set up to automatically format and lint code before each commit.

First, install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

Every time you make a commit, pre-commit will run these tools and ensure that your code adheres to the specified code style.

Alternatively, you can run the pre-commit hooks manually:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

Run the test suite using:

```bash
make test
```

Or directly with pytest:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

- **Code Style**: Ensure code is formatted with `black` and imports are sorted with `isort`.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass.
- **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes.

### Coding Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
